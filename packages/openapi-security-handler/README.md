# openapi-security-handler [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Downloads][downloads-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Coveralls Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]
> A library to process OpenAPI security definitions in parallel.

## Highlights

* Easily handle security schemes.
* Performant.
* Extensively tested.
* Small footprint.
* Currently supports openapi 2.0 (f.k.a. swagger 2.0) security definitions.

## Example

See `./test/data-driven/*.js` for more examples.

```javascript
var OpenapiSecurityHandler = require('openapi-security-handler');
var handler = new OpenapiSecurityHandler({
  // these are typically taken from the global api doc
  securityDefinitions: {
    keyScheme: {
      type: 'apiKey',
      name: 'api_key',
      in: 'header'
    },
    passwordScheme: {
      type: 'basic'
    }
  },
  // these handle the operation security reference
  securityHandlers: {
    keyScheme: function(req, scopes, securityDefinition, cb) {
      req.user = {name: 'fred'};
      cb(null, true);// pass true if validation succeeds, false otherwise.
    },
    passwordScheme: function(req, scopes, securityDefinition, cb) {
      req.user = {name: 'fred'};
      cb(null, true);
    }
  },
  // These are typically defined on an operation's openapi document.
  operationSecurity: [
    // we'll execute all the schemes in the object.  If any fail, we'll move to the
    // next object.
    {
      keyScheme: ['write']
    },
    {
      passwordScheme: ['write']
    }
  ],
});
var request = {};
handler.handle(request, (err, result) => {
  console.log(result); // => true
});
```

## Response

`openapi-security-handler#handle` will return the following errors:

* `401`
  * This error is returned if:
    * `cb(null, false)` is called from all `securityHandlers`.
    * `cb({status: 401, challange: 'a challenge string like "Basic"'})` is called
      from at least one of the handlers in the last set of security handlers.
* `403`
  * This error is returned if:
    * `cb({status: 403, message: 'some message'})` is called
      from at least one of the handlers in the last set of security handlers.
* `500`
  * This error is returned if:
    * An unknown `status` is passed to `cb`.
    * No security handlers yield `true`.

## Successful Authentication

Upon successful authentication the `cb` is called with `null, true`.  Handlers should
assign credentials to the request object.
